# Variables
By Carl Shan of [The Nueva School](www.nuevaschool.org)
Variables is one of the most important and universal ideas in programming.

## What are variables?
A `variable` is something that stores some data that we want to use later.

We use variables all the time in programming, and this is one of the fundamental topics to know.

Variables generally look something like this:

`name = 'Carl'`

For example below I will make three variables in Python below:

```python
school = 'Nueva'

age = 14

subject = 'Data Analytics'
```

### A visual metaphor

To help you remember variables, think of them this way.

Imagine them as an empty box:

When you create a variable, you a really making a box, labeling it and putting some objects inside of it.

## How do we make variables?
Variables in Python are simply declared using the following syntax:

```python 
your_variable_here = 'your_value_here' 
```

Here are a few examples:

**Example 1: You can set variables to numbers.**

```python
x = 5
```

**Example 2: You can also set variables to pieces of text, which in programming we call `strings` (since pieces of text are simply *strings* of letters).**

```python
my_name = 'Carl'
```

**Example 3: You can also combine variables together.**

```python
x = 1 
y = 2
z = x + y 
print(z) # This will print 3

```

**Important**: In the above example the `#` symbol in Python is used to denote a comment.
