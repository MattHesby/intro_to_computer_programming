# Terminal

The Terminal is an application that you have on your computer. We will be using it in class to execute programs you write.

## Commands

Here are a list of some of the commands you should be familiar with in class.

### `ls`
> This will list the folders and files in the folder that you are currently in.

### `cd`
> `cd` stands for *`c`hange `d`irectory*. In programming lingo, *directory* means the equivalent of *folder*. 
> 
> To use it you type `cd <some folder here>`.
> 
> Examples:
> 
> * `cd desktop`
> * `cd downloads`
> * `cd ..` - this will go up a folder.
> 
> Keep in mind that if your folder has spaces in it, you will need to wrap it in `"`.
> 
> Example:
> 
> * `cd "my folder with spaces"`
> 
> 
> The `home` folder is the folder where your user files are contained. A shortcut is to `cd ~`.


### `touch`
> This will create empty files.
>
> Examples:
>
> * `touch secret.txt`
> * `touch empty_image.jpg`
> * `touch empty_audio.mp4`


### `mkdir`
> Just like how `touch` makes files, `mkdir` makes empty folders.
> 
> Examples:
> 
> * `mkdir some_folder`
> * `mkdir "folder with spaces`

### `rm` and `rmdir`
> `rm` removes files.
> 
> Example:
> 
> * `rm somefile.txt`
> * `rm "file with spaces.txt"`
> 
> `rmdir` removes folders.
> 
> **NOTE:** These folders need to be empty in order for rmdir to work.
> 
> Examples:
> 
> * `rmdir empty_folder`
